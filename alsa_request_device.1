.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-priority\fR <int>
reservation priority (default: int32_max)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-pid\fR <int>
process\-id to watch (default 0: none)
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR <string>
application name to use for registration
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-releasewait\fR

.PP
This tool issues a dbus request to reserve an ALSA Audio\-device.
If successful other users of the device (e.g. pulseaudio) will
release the device.
.PP
alsa_request_device by default announces itself as "ALSA User"
and uses the maximum possible priority for requesting the device.
These settings can be overriden using the \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-p\fR options respectively.
.PP
If a PID is given the tool will watch the process and if that is not running
release the device and exit.  Otherwise alsa_request_device runs until
either stdin is closed, a SIGINT or SIGTERM is received or some other
application requests the device with a higher priority.
.PP
Without the \fB\-w\fR option, alsa_request_device yields the device after 500ms to
any higher\-priority request. With the \fB\-w\fR option this tool waits until it
for SIGINT or SIGTERM \- but at most 4 sec to acknowledge before releasing.
.PP
The audio\-device argument is an ID string e.g. 'Audio1' (as understood by
dbus) or alternatively an ALSA hardware name e.g. 'hw:SB' may be given.
.SH EXAMPLES
alsa_request_device Audio0
